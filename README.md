# Images
This repository contains images and other blobs that I use on my website.

By storing this content here, instead of on my blog, my Jekyll site stays lean, mean, and quick to deploy.

## Thumbnails

This repository uses a GitHub Action to automatically generate thumbnails less than 1000 pixels tall (or wide) for all images uploaded with relatively normal extensions.
Please keep full size images below 5MB in size, so users can view them directly on GitHub, instead of having to download them.
